# Linting HTML/Twig

In this configuration, we are not really talking about linting, but more about formatting. To ensure a common and homogeneous quality of our HTML/Twig files, we are using Prettier to (re)format our code and to take a look on our staged files before committing.

In order to simplify your life, make sure that your IDE is properly configured to handle Prettier. Otherwise, you can also run the **fix** command with `yarn fix:html`.

We also recommend that you install something like [Headwind](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=heybourn.headwind) to automatically set the correct Tailwind classes order in your HTML/Twig files.
